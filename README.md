## E7Web

E7Web is a documentation website for the mobile game Epic Seven. It was built with a React/Redux front end and a Rails API backend. It uses an API made specifically for the game, as well as personal seed data for character suggestions.

It features character stats, stories, and suggested weapons/artifacts (extra accessories) for them to use.

It offers a chat feature so users on the site can interact with one another in case they have questions or other concerns.

## Libraries

I used Semantic for most of my styling, and I also used Streamchat for a already well implemented chat system that offers many different features! (picture upload, emojis, reactions etc).
